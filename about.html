    <h2>About</h2>
    <br>
   <h4>Background</h4>
   <p>African-Americans disproportionately suffer from health issues more than any other population. There is compelling evidence that there is a definite need for the population to be educated, empowered and given the tools to change their health outcomes. It is absolutely necessary that the nation’s health improve. That will require federal, state and local agencies to work with communities at a grass roots level.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Currently, very few organizations are able to penetrate African-American faith-based organizations. The Rochester Health Engagement Partners (RHEP) were able achieve that. RHEP became a trusted resource to the churches in a variety of ways. Community Health Engagement Partners is formerly known as RHEP, the organization from which it evolved. There are some organizations that perform a segment of what Community Health Engagement Partners provide. However, the services and tools provided to educate and empower individuals are limited. Community Engagement Partners will be a total service provider for the African-American faith-based community.</p>
